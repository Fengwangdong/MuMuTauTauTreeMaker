# MuMuTauTauTreelizerThis tool is used to treelize MiniAOD (or reMiniAOD) samples. The output files contain vectors of different objects (eg. muons, electrons, taus) and flat branches of object counters (eg. number of vertices, event weights etc.).# Introduction for setting up the environment:$ export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc900$ cmsrel CMSSW_12_0_0_pre4$ cd CMSSW_12_0_0_pre4/src$ cmsenv$ git cms-init$ git clone https://github.com/Fengwangdong/MuMuTauTauTreeMaker.git -b UL120X$ bash MuMuTauTauTreeMaker/MuTauTreelizer/recipe/recipe.sh # Recipe for implanting latest Egamma ID dependence$ scram b clean$ scram b -j4NOTE: The configurations for 2016, 2017 and 2018 Ultra-legacy datasets are different, so run them separately. When executing the scripts below, one needs to customize several items accordingly:[1] isMC: 1 = MC; 0 = data.[2] era:* 2016preVFP (2016preVFP-UL)* 2016postVFP (2016postVFP-UL) * 2017 (2017-UL)* 2018 (2018-UL)[3] inputFiles: path + input file (file by file, wildcards do not work).# Run the treelizer:$ cd MuMuTauTauTreeMaker/MuTauTreelizer/test$ cmsRun runDiMuDiTau_cfg.py isMC=1(0) era=2017 inputFiles=/PATH/file1.root inputFiles=/PATH/file2.root# CRAB submission:One can copy and modify this "example_crabSub.py". These items to be modified:* config.General.requestName = 'YOURS' (Customize it according to which year's which sample)* config.JobType.psetName = '../../runDiMuDiTau_cfg.py' (set the correct directory path to access this execution script)* config.JobType.pyCfgParams = ["isMC=1","numThreads=4","era=YOURS"] (The "isMC" and "era" need to be set as described above)* config.Data.inputDataset = 'YOURS' (Take the published dataset name of the last step)* config.Data.outLFNDirBase = '/store/user/YOURS/Treelization/' (Use your username in the output site)* config.Data.outputDatasetTag = 'YOURS' (Customize it according to which year's which sample)* config.Site.storageSite = 'YOURS' (Use the T2/T3 site name that you intend to store your outputs)
